Q=1 What is the default value of Array for different data types?
The default value of an array depends on the data type of its elements. For primitive types, such as 
int, char, boolean, etc., the default value is zero or false. For reference types, such as String, Object, etc.,
the default value is nul.

Q2 Can you access the negative number in Array indices?
You cannot pass a negative number as an array size in Java. If you do so, you will get a runtime exception of type NegativeArraySizeException34. 
The size of an array must be a positive integer or zero.

Q3 Where does Array stored in JVM memory?
Arrays are stored in the heap area of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The heap is where Java objects and arrays are 
allocated and deallocated. The stack area of the JVM is where local variables and method calls are stored56.

Q4 What are the disadvantages of Array?
Arrays have a fixed size, so resizing is not straightforward.
Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an array is inefficient.
Arrays can only store elements of the same data type.

Q5 What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Can you give an example?
An anonymous array is an array that is created without explicitly assigning it to a variable. It is used for instant and one-time
 usage only, such as passing it as an argument to a method or as a value in an expression. The syntax of an anonymous array is:
new <data type> [] {<list of values with comma separator>};
For example
sum (new int [] {1, 2, 3});910

Q6 What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java?
You can use a for loop, an enhanced for loop, or Java 8 streams to traverse an array. 

Q7 What is the difference between length and length() in Java? Can you give examples?
In Java, length is an attribute of arrays, while length() is a method of strings.
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
System.out.println(arr.length); 
String str = "Hello";
System.out.println(str.length());
